A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements in the respective data structure.

Types of Sorting Techniques
There are various sorting algorithms are used in data structures. The following two types of sorting algorithms can be broadly classified:

1) Comparison-based: We compare the elements in a comparison-based sorting algorithm)
2) Non-comparison-based: We do not compare the elements in a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm)
