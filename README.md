## Algorithm Complexity 
Let X = algorithm and n = size of input data 
Time and Space used by algorith X are two main factors which decide efficiency of X. 

1) Time Factor : Measured by counting the number of key operations . 
2) Space Factor : Measured by counting the maximum memory space required by algorithm. 

## Time Complexity
The time required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called time complexity  of the algorithm.It quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. 
Tc(n) = c * n 
where, n = no. of steps in algorithm 
       c = time taken in each step
